Explanation: 
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT employee_id,
IF((employee_id % 2) != 0 and name not like 'M%', salary, 0) as bonus from Employees
order by employee_id;
